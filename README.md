# Fake Kali Linux Login

A small web app that emulates the login screen of the Kali Linux distribution. You can use it to steal someones credentials.
Or even better: Leave you laptop open with this page and use the webcam to find out who messes with your computer. Or do whatever crazy stuff you can think of.
